# **Threat Intelligence Basics**

---

## 🎯 **Lab Objective**

The objective of this lab is to help SOC Analysts learn how to extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from a suspicious email and use **threat intelligence tools** to investigate their context and maliciousness.

## 📘 **What is Threat Intelligence?**

**Threat Intelligence (TI)** is information about threats, threat actors, and their tactics. It helps SOC analysts investigate alerts faster, make informed decisions, and respond to incidents more effectively.

### 💡 Types of Threat Intelligence:
- **Tactical:** IOCs like IPs, hashes, domains
- **Operational:** Info about campaigns, malware families
- **Strategic:** Big-picture trends, threat groups, geopolitical context

## 💼 **Scenario:**

While triaging a phishing alert, you discovered three suspicious indicators:

- IP Address: 18.188.148.80
- Domain: aaronthompson.ug
- File Hash(SHA256): d45a079c59c2860f9cf4578a8fc9f5fe8009cff8aaa83c572474d6bfe15ba95b
